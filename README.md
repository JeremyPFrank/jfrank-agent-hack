# Build An Agent Hackathon

Welcome to the **Build An Agent Hackathon**! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to create intelligent AI agents that can perform complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools. You'll build a **Document Generation Agent** - an intelligent system that can research any topic, create comprehensive outlines, write detailed sections, and compile professional reports automatically. Unlike simple workflows, agents are intelligent programs that can adapt to changing requirements, choose tools dynamically, and perform complex reasoning and planning.

## My Project

**Coach AI**

Coach AI is a simple cli multi-agent system that takes user input to learn about the user's backgroud, goals, experience, and daily commitment before researching goal-specific literature on optimal training. It then generates a detailed report with a weekly workout plan complete with warm ups and workouts, both outlining exercises and giving the same technical cues a fully certified personal trainer would supply to execute the exercises at a higher level. Recovery days are built in and include hydration and nutrition tips to optimze the days when the body gets to heal. The system is built using Tavily, LangChain and NVIDIA's cutting edge reasoning and action models hosted on brev to allow users to easily access and run the system.
